# Ackerman-Optimization
Used Python to calculate Ackerman and Ackerman Percentage while simultaneously creating a database which stores all the iterations with their inputs, outputs and date &amp; time of calculation.

## Ackerman Geometry 
Ackerman steering geometry is a geometric arrangement of linkages in the steering of a vehicle designed to solve the problem of wheels on the inside and outside of a turn needing to trace out circles of different radii.<br/>
In a typical Ackerman steering system, the car has tie-rod linkages and steering arms that form an approximate parallelogram which skews to one side as the wheels turn. If the steering arms are parallel, then both wheels are steered to the same angle.
